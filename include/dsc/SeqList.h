    Since LNode is a structure containing an array, directly passing this structure as 
    a function parameter is clearly not a good approach when implementing various operations 
    for sequential lists. Using a structure pointer for passing is more efficient, so we 
    define List as a structure pointer. This allows us to use List to define a linear list L: List L, 
    through which we can access the contents of the corresponding linear list. 
    For example, L->Data[i], and the length of the linear list can be obtained by L->Last + 1.
